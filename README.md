# Microdeft React Test - Samsel Arfin

This is a React project that demonstrates the implementation of forms for user registration, login, and course management. It communicates with an API to send and fetch data related to users and courses. The project is built using React, Axios for API calls, and Bootstrap for styling.

## Features

- **Registration Form**: Allows users to register by entering their `name`, `email`, and `password`.
- **Login Form**: Users can log in using `email` and `password` and receive a token for further authenticated requests.
- **Create Course Form**: Allows authorized users to add new courses with details like `title`, `description`, `badge_text`, and `instructor_name`.
- **Course List**: Fetches and displays courses in a card format, ensuring that users are authenticated using the provided token.
